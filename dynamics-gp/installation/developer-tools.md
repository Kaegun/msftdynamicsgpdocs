# Developer Tools

This documentation supports developers who work with Microsoft Dynamics GP.

## eConnect 

This documentation contains detailed information about the operations, classes, XML schemas and nodes available in Microsoft [Dynamics GP eConnect](/previous-versions/dynamicsgp/developer/bb219081(v=msdn.10)). 

The Microsoft eConnect procedures are encrypted to preserve the Microsoft intellectual property.

Business Logic Modification: eConnect provides both Pre and Post procedures for modifying business logic before passing a transaction through eConnect to Microsoft Dynamics GP. If these procedures were not encrypted, unauthorized modifications could be made, potentially leading to incorrect business logic application and data corruption.

Therefore, keeping Dynamics eConnect procedures encrypted is essential for data security, compliance with standards, and maintaining the integrity of business logic. Itâ€™s advised against modifying any Dynamics GP stored procedures as it may cause problems with your Microsoft Dynamics GP data.

However, over the years, we have found some issues with a few of the eConnect procedures based on business practices for a specific company. Microsoft is not actively fixing these issues in the eConnect shipping product, due to the life cycle of the product. The below published procedures are modified eConnect procedures with fixes around areas a large majority of customers have run into.

These modified procedures are use at your own risk and should be tested by your company before using in your production system.  When you upgrade Microsoft Dynamics GP, these modified procedures may be lost.
